Pretend You're Xyzzy
===================
A fork of the original Pretend You're Xyzzy. Complete re-write of the frontend, and major changes in the backend. Finished product will have material design, work fairly decently on mobile devices, and have server that is self-contained instead of depending on Tomcat.

TODO
====
- Make server standlone (no need of Tomcat)
- Refractor code
- Fix present bugs
- Better card loading system

If you have any others please open an issue or a pull request.
